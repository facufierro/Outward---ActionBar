- **Hide Slot Functionality**: Added the ability to hide/disable specific action slots (Right-Click in Hotkey Mode).
- **Bug Fix**: Disabled right-click functionality for adding skills to specific slots to fix a bug where "Summon Will-o-Wisp" was incorrectly appearing.
- **Streamlined Features**:
    - **Disabled** Equipment Sets.
    - **Disabled** Durability functions (only the Action Bar overlay remains).
    - **Disabled** all features not related to the Action Bar and UI reordering.
